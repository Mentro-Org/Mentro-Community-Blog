Getting a mentor early in life is very important if you want to get ahead of the crowd, and stand out. 

## Choose the Right One
It is important to choose the right mentor who is going to put an impact on your life, for the next few years. Talking and sharing ideas with experienced and like-minded people is important, at the same time it’s important to understand how to extract meaning out of it and make impactful decisions.

Often people get confused trying to follow every piece of advice, and end up being lost. It is very important to choose the right one and narrow the information down to a single piece of advice, before making a decision. 

Find the people you look up to or look for people who have succeeded in what you want to achieve, and connect. 

Keep following till the end there is a hidden bonus tip to help you get started.

## What to Expect
We all want that glimpse of success but don’t expect someone else to drive you there. It’s your boat, be the sailor but at the same time keep in touch with your guide to keep moving in the right direction.

A mentor will guide you through difficult situations or might help you prepare for the worst but it’s you who need to face it, overthrow the odds, and make it possible.

## Avoid mistakes


People usually make a few mistakes, make sure you don’t make them:
